//change active stage
//add class active to element
//and remove class active from previous element
//use addEventListener to each element
//when an element get e => click .then add .active class to element
//how to remove previous class from element?
//each page have a active class on it nav bar?
//like history.html have <li>history</li> have active class 
//so, just add active class in each page?
//yes, like when you click on history btn on main page, it redirect you to history page and in history page, the <li> history </li> have .active class in default.
//So, i think we just need windows.location to change page.
//just simply make the <li> xxx </li> contain a <a> ./xxx.html </a> 
//OK.
